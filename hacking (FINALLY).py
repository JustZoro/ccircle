#--- HACKING, EXPLIOTING, and DENIAL OF SERVICE --------------------------

  #DDOS (Denial of Service)

       #(Effectively) shut down a service by flooding it with requests or sending it requests that drain computational power

  #DDOS (Distributed Denial of Service)

    #Same as above, but with *multiple* machines, connections, etc.
    #Just scaling up the DOS to make it more powerful :)

    #100 machines > 1 machine (duh)
